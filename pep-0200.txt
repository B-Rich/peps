Introduction

    This PEP describes the Python 2.0 release schedule, tracking the
    status and ownership of the major new features, summarizes
    discussions held in mailing list forums, and provides URLs for
    further information, patches, and other outstanding issues.  The
    CVS revision history of this file contains the definitive
    historical record.

Accepted and completed

Accepted and in progress

    * SyntaxError enhancements - Fredrik Lundh
      http://www.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-July/012981.html

    * interface to poll system call - Andrew Kuchling
      An OO interface to the poll system call will be added to the
      select module.

    * Compression of Unicode database - Fredrik Lundh
      http://hem.passagen.se/eff/bot.htm#456806

    * SRE - Fredrik Lundh
      The test suite still fails on test_re.

    * snprintf - owner???
      Use snprintf to avoid buffer overflows.  Need configure hackery
      to discovery if it is available on the current platform and a
      default implementation if it is not.
      http://www.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-April/010051.html
      This function is expected to be part of C9X (check).

    * Support for opcode arguments > 2**16 - Charles Waldman
      Source files longer than 32K and sequences with more than 32K
      elements both fail because opcode arguments are limited to
      16-bit values.

    * Range literals - Thomas Wouters
      Make range(1, 10, 2) == [1:10:2]

Open: proposed but not accepted or declined

    * List comprehensions - Tim Peters?
      Need a coherent proposal.  Lots of confusing discussion going
      on.

    * Eliminated SET_LINENO opcode - Vladimir Marangozov
      Small optimization achieved by using the code object's lnotab
      instead of the SET_LINENO instruction.  Uses code rewriting
      technique (that Guido's growns on) to support debugger, which
      uses SET_LINENO.
