Abstract

    Python's interactive mode is one of the implementation's great
    strengths -- being able to write expressions on the command line
    and get back a meaningful output.  However, the output function
    cannot be all things to all people, and the current output
    function too often falls short of this goal.  This PEP describes a
    way to provides alternatives to the built-in display function in
    Python, so users will have control over the output from the
    interactive interpreter.
