Abstract

    This PEP proposes a C and Python level API, as well as command
    line flags, to issue warning messages and control what happens to
    them.  This is mostly based on GvR's proposal posted to python-dev
    on 05-Nov-2000, with some ideas (such as using classes to
    categorize warnings) merged in from Paul Prescod's
    counter-proposal posted on the same date.
