Abstract

    Change \x escapes, in both 8-bit and Unicode strings, to consume
    exactly the two hex digits following.  The proposal views this as
    correcting an original design flaw, leading to clearer expression
    in all flavors of string, a cleaner Unicode story, better
    compatibility with Perl regular expressions, and with minimal risk
    to existing code.
