Abstract

    Sets are a fundamental mathematical structure, and are commonly
    used to both specify and implement programs.  Sets are often
    implemented as dictionaries with "don't care" values, but this
    leaves the meaning of intersection, union, difference, and other
    basic operations are ambiguous.  This PEP therefore proposes
    syntax and semantics for a concrete, built-in set type.
