Introduction

    This PEP contains a list of small feature requests that may be
    considered for future versions of Python.  Large feature requests
    are not included here, but are described in separate PEPs.  See
    pep-0000.txt for details.


Core Language


Standard Library

    - The urllib module should support proxies which require
      authenication.  See SourceForge bug #110619 for information:

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110619&group_id=5470

    - A builtin function that returns the number of bytes an object
      uses internally.  Apparently mxTools has a sizeof function that
      returns the size of the object struct itself.
