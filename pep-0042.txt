Introduction

    This PEP contains a list of small feature requests that may be
    considered for future versions of Python.  Large feature requests
    are not included here, but are described in separate PEPs.  See
    pep-0000.txt for details.


Core Language / Builtins

    - A builtin function that returns the number of bytes an object
      uses internally.  Apparently mxTools has a sizeof function that
      returns the size of the object struct itself.

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110835&group_id=5470

    - Add C API functions to help Windows users who are building
      embedded applications where the FILE * structure does not match
      the FILE * the interpreter was compiled with.

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110821&group_id=5470

      See this bug report for a specific suggestion that will allow a
      Borland C++ builder application to interact with a python.dll
      build with MSVC.


Standard Library

    - The urllib module should support proxies which require
      authenication.  See SourceForge bug #110619 for information:

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110619&group_id=5470

    - Support passive FTP via urllib

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110848&group_id=5470

    - Use objects with attributes in place of tuples of values for
      return values in several places in the library.  Two specific
      APIs which could use this treatment include os.stat() and
      os.statvfs(); see SourceForge bug #111481:

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=111481&group_id=5470

      which shows very specifically why this approach is better than
      the tuple approach: additional attributes can be added as needed
      without having as detrimental an affect on existing code.

    - os.rename() should be modified to handle EXDEV errors on
      platforms that don't allow rename() to operate across filesystem
      boundaries by copying the file over and removing the original.
      Linux is one system that requires this treatment.

Tools

    - IDLE should reload & recompile modules changed externally.  To
      be done properly, scripts will have to be run in a separate
      process.
