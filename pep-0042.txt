Introduction

    This PEP contains a list of small feature requests that may be
    considered for future versions of Python.  Large feature requests
    are not included here, but are described in separate PEPs.  See
    pep-0000.txt for details.


Core Language


Standard Library

    - The urllib module should support proxies which require
      authenication.  See SourceForge bug #110619 for information:

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110619&group_id=5470

    - A builtin function that returns the number of bytes an object
      uses internally.  Apparently mxTools has a sizeof function that
      returns the size of the object struct itself.

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=110835&group_id=5470

    - Add C API functions to help Windows users who are building
      embedded applications where the FILE * structure does not match
      the FILE * the interpreter was compiled with.

      See this bug report for a specific suggestion that will allow a
      Borland C++ builder application to interact with a python.dll
      build with MSVC.
