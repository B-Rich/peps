Abstract

    This document describes the post-Python 2.1 development and
    release schedule.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with
    PEP-sized items.  Small bug fixes and changes will occur up until
    the first beta release.

    NOTE: the schedule below and the list of features under
    consideration are all subject to change!  If the energy in the
    community changes or the feedback on a PEP is particularly
    positive or negative, this may affect decisions.


Release Schedule

    Tentative future release dates (compare pep-0226) 

    17-Oct-2001: 2.2 (final release)
    10-Oct-2001: 2.2c1 (release candidate)
    19-Sep-2001: 2.2b2
    29-Aug-2001: 2.2b1
     8-Aug-2001: 2.2a2
    18-Jul-2001: 2.2a1


Release Mechanics

    I'd like to experiment with a new mechanism for releases: a week
    before every alpha, beta or other release, I'll fork off a branch
    which will become the release; changes to the branch will have to
    be approved before they can be checked in.  This is how some other
    large projects (e.g. Mozilla) work, and I hope it will help reduce
    the number of bugs introduced in releases at the last minute.


Planned features for 2.2

    The following features are already checked in on the head revision
    (for a more detailed account, see Misc/NEWS):

    - iterators (pep-0234)

    The following features are scheduled to go in; work is still
    ongoing in defining the exact appearance of the features:

    - generators (pep-0255)
    - unification of types and classes (pep-0252, pep-0253, pep-0254)

    The following features are under consideration:

    - a standard set API (implemented in Python for now) (pep-0218)
    - a 'directive' statement (pep-0244)
    - unifying long ints and plain ints (pep-0237)

    There needs to be more discussion of each of these before we can
    decide.
