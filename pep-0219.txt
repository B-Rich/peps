PEP: 219
Title: Stackless Python
Version: $Revision$
Author: gmcm@hypernet.com (Gordon McMillan)
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Python-Version: 2.1
Created: 14-Aug-2000

Abstract

    Argues for changes (mostly to ceval.c and frameobject.c) that
    disentangle Python's stack usage from the C stack.  Each frame
    gets its own stacklet (just enough for its requirements).  Also
    changes ceval.c so that the ceval.c does not cause the interpreter
    to recurse (although other C code may still do so).  No impact on
    Python's syntax or semantics.
